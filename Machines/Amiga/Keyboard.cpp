// Notes to self:
//
//
// Before
// the transmission starts, both KCLK and KDAT are high.  The keyboard starts
// the transmission by putting out the first data bit (on KDAT), followed by
// a pulse on KCLK (low then high); then it puts out the second data bit and
// pulses KCLK until all eight data bits have been sent.
//
// When the computer has received the eighth bit, it must pulse KDAT low for
// at least 1 (one) microsecond, as a handshake signal to the keyboard. The
// keyboard must be able to detect pulses greater than or equal
// to 1 microsecond.  Software MUST pulse the line low for 85 microseconds to
// ensure compatibility with all keyboard models.
//
//
// If the handshake pulse does not arrive within
// 143 ms of the last clock of the transmission, the keyboard will assume
// that the computer is still waiting for the rest of the transmission and is
// therefore out of sync.  The keyboard will then attempt to restore sync by
// going into "resync mode."  In this mode, the keyboard clocks out a 1 and
// waits for a handshake pulse. If none arrives within 143 ms, it clocks out
// another 1 and waits again.
//
// The keyboard Hard Resets the Amiga by pulling KCLK low and starting a 500
// millisecond timer.   When one or more of the keys is released and 500
// milliseconds have passed, the keyboard will release KCLK.
//
// The usual sequence of events will therefore be:  power-up; synchronize;
// transmit "initiate power-up key stream" ($FD); transmit "terminate key
// stream" ($FE).
