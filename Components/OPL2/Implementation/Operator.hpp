/*!
	Models an operator.

	In Yamaha FM terms, an operator is a combination of a few things:

		* an oscillator, producing one of a handful of sine-derived waveforms;
		* an ADSR output level envelope; and
		* a bunch of potential adjustments to those two things:
			* optional tremolo and/or vibrato (the rates of which are global);
			* the option to skip 'sustain' in ADSR and go straight to release (since no sustain period is supplied,
				it otherwise runs for as long as the programmer leaves a channel enabled);
			* an attenuation for the output level; and
			* a factor by which to speed up the ADSR envelope as a function of frequency.

	Oscillator period isn't set directly, it's a multiple of the owning channel, in which
	period is set as a combination of f-num and octave.
