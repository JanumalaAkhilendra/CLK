/*!
	This implementation of the TMS, etc mediates between three clocks:

	1)	the external clock, which is whatever the rest of the system(s)
		it plugs into run at;

	2)	the internal clock, which is used to time and place syncs, borders,
		pixel regions, etc; and

	3)	a memory acccess clock, which correlates to the number of windows
		available for memory accesses.

	E.g. for both a regular TMS9918 and the Sega Master System, the external
	clock is 3.58Mhz, the internal clock is 5.37Mhz and the memory access
	clock is 2.69Mhz.

	Both the Yamaha extensions and the Mega Drive VDP are a bit smarter about
	paged mode memory accesses, obviating any advantage to treating (3) as a
	separate clock.
