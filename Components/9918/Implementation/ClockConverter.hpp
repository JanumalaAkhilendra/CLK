/*!
	This implementation of the TMS, etc mediates between three clocks:

	1)	the external clock, which is whatever the rest of the system(s)
		it plugs into run at;

	2)	the internal clock, which is used to time and place syncs, borders,
		pixel regions, etc; and

	3)	a memory acccess clock, which correlates to the number of windows
		available for memory accesses.

	E.g. for both a regular TMS9918 and the Sega Master System, the external
	clock is 3.58Mhz, the internal clock is 5.37Mhz and the memory access
	clock is 2.69Mhz.

	Or, put another way, for both a TMS9918 and Master System:

	* 228 external cycles;
	* is 342 internal cycles;
	* which exactly covers 228 NTSC colour clocks; and
	* contains 171 memory access windows.

	Both the Yamaha extensions and the Mega Drive VDP are a bit smarter about
	paged mode memory accesses, obviating any advantage to treating (3) as a
	separate clock.
