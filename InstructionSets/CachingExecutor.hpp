	A caching executor makes use of an instruction set-specific executor to cache 'performers' (i.e. function pointers)
	that result from decoding.

	In other words, it's almost a JIT compiler, but producing threaded code (in the Forth sense) and then incurring whatever
	costs sit behind using the C ABI for calling. Since there'll always be exactly one parameter, being the specific executor,
	hopefully the calling costs are acceptable.

	Intended usage is for specific executors to subclass from this and declare it a friend.

	TODO: determine promises re: interruption, amongst other things.
