# 6502Esque

This folder contains common code for CPUs for a 6502-esque bus interface; it also contains a special template, the 6502Selector, which allows a consumer to select between the 6502-esque chips by enum.

If you know exactly which processor you want, feel free to ignore this folder entirely; just go straight to the 6502, 65816 or whatever.
