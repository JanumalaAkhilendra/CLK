# flamewing's 68000 BCD tests

These test results were generated by code obtained from https://github.com/flamewing/68k-bcd-verifier

The code itself is licensed under the GPL 3.0; the file included here is not part of the original repository but is generated as part of the build process so it is probably safest to assume it is covered by the GPL despite the rule that program output isn't covered â€” it is arguably part of the program, not program output.
